This repository contains engineering materials for a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2023.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in the form of JPEG, PNG, or PDF of the electromechanical components, illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition.

## Introduction

Our robot, a compact Arduino Uno-based robot, has been designed to excel in the WRO Future Engineers competition. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of its components, design rationale, and the code that drives its performance. The robot employs advanced features such as ultrasonic sensors and a Pixy camera for accurate obstacle detection and color recognition. This document serves as a guide for those interested in understanding and replicating our robot's functionality.
